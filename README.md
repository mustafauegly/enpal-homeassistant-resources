# enpal-homeassistant-resources

This is a meta repository that collects instructions,
hints, default configuration to setup the default Enpal
solar inverters to home assistant. Furthermore guidelines
to setup the forwarding of the data to an InfluxDB and
Grafana will be shown.

The main goal is to setup you own local maintainace
system so that you do not need the buggy Enpal App.
